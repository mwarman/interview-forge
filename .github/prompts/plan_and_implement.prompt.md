Plan and implement a change to the codebase.

---

**Step 1 — Read & Plan** _(stop here until I respond)_

1. Read the affected source files to understand existing conventions (naming, structure, error handling, test style).
2. Identify all changes required: source, tests, docs.
3. Present a numbered implementation plan.
4. Flag any ambiguity or architectural decisions to resolve — ask before assuming.
5. Ask: **A) Autonomous** (implement fully, report when done) or **B) Step-by-step** (pause after each step for confirmation)?

---

**Step 2 — Implement**

Execute the approved plan:

- **Code**: Match existing conventions. Flag deviations before introducing them. See AGENTS.md
- **Tests**: Cover happy path, edge cases, and failure paths using the existing test framework.
- **Docs**: Update README if behavior changes; add inline comments for non-obvious logic; update `/docs` if affected.

If you encounter scope not covered in the plan, stop and report before continuing.

**Step 3 — Done Criteria**

Confirm before closing:

- [ ] Lint passes, no new warnings
- [ ] All tests pass, no unjustified skips
- [ ] New tests cover happy path, edge cases, failure paths
- [ ] No debug code, commented-out blocks, or unresolved TODOs
- [ ] Docs reflect post-change behavior

Provide a brief summary: what changed, what was tested, any follow-up items worth filing.
